# üìñ Create a portfoilo for future employers to view.

## User Story

Hello.
I want future employers to be able to access my portfolio with my current projects. I also want them to see the evolution from when I started coding to to where I am now. My first project was refactoring a website with starter code(HTML, CSS and a readme with the image(https://phagn131.github.io/code-refactor)). Once established in the developer community I want to branch out and work for companies that use technologies that are on the cutting edge; i.e. neuromorphic computing, quantum computing...or whatever comes after them. I look forward to the journey.

## Project Summation
In this project I created a 
responsive website that includes my name, information about my work, some things about me, and how to contact me through several links.
